    "description": "Exposed IDOR vulnerability in the web dashboard allowed for the download of other users' network captures. Analysis of a specific PCAP file revealed cleartext FTP credentials. After gaining a shell, local enumeration showed that Python 3.8 was configured with dangerous capabilities (cap_setuid,cap_net_bind_service+eip). This misconfiguration allowed for an immediate privilege escalation to root by manipulating the process UID via a simple python script.",
